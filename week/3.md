# Week 3: January 22-25, 2019

## Arduino, the Language

When we discuss Arduino in this course, it's important to remember that Arduino refers to one of the following:

* Arduino the <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/1/e/4/8/515b4656ce395f8a38000000.png" target="_blank">**Microcontroller**</a> (Hardware)
* Arduino the <a href="https://core-electronics.com.au/media/wysiwyg/tutorials/aidan/arduino-ide.png" target="_blank">**Program**</a> (Software)
* Arduino the **Language** (C++ based coding language) 

The distinction is based on the context - during the last two weeks, we've focused on the Arduino **microcontroller** when building circuits. This week, we will be learning how to better manipulate the **program** (also called the **IDE**, or **Integrated Development Environment**) and the **language**, our human-like high-level language that gets compiled by the IDE.

When working in the Arduino IDE, we refer to new files as **sketches**.  Each time you open a new sketch, you'll be greeted by the following lines of code:

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

What does this tell us? And what do the words "void," "setup," and "loop" have to do with anything? Let's start by breaking it into two parts.

```c++
void setup(){
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  
}
```

When coding, there will often be little included in the default file. What Arduino gives us as a starting point are two **functions**, discussed below, and **comments,** indicated by the **"//"** marks. A comment in code is ignored by the computer, but provides a human user with a better understanding of what a line of code means.

Our comment, then, indicates the purpose of **void setup()** - one of two primary **functions** in an Arduino sketch. Functions are blocks of code that _do something_, to put it simply - and what that _something_ is can be vague or confusing without comments. **void setup()** is the _name_ of our function that runs one time each time you upload code to the Arduino, reset it, or simply provide the power it needs to turn on. This is a great place for code that only has to happen once, like turning on an LED to indicate that your project is turned on. 

The placements of these comments is as important as their message. On either side of the comments, you'll see what are called **curly brackets**, or **{ }**; everything between those two curly brackets indicate where lines of code will be executed and in what order. Misplaced or entirely missing curly brackets are a common error in code, so make sure to check your functions for both an _opening_ ( { ) and _closing_ ( } ) bracket.

Using what we just learned, let's examine the other function: **void loop()**.

```c++
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

What this function performs may be a little less clear unless we understand that computers are used as a way to automate the process of doing mundane tasks - repeatedly, often hundreds or thousands of times per second. **void loop()** is a function that runs a block of code as fast as possible, unless otherwise noted by the user. If you want to turn an LED on and off many times a second or perform a mathematical equation (like counting seconds), void loop() is the place to do that.
