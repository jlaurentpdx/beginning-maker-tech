# Week 9-10: March 4 - 15, 2019

For the next two weeks, we will be building and designing a digital clock using the DS3231 real-time clock (RTC) component and a 16x2 liquid crystal display (LCD), finishing it out with a custom laser cut or 3D printed enclosure.

## Building an Arduino-powered Digital Clock

**Step 1:** Set up the LCD display according to the tutorial [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-4a-lcd-hello-world)

**Step 2:** Download the RTC DS3231 library [from this website](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=73) and save it to your Downloads folder. Connect the RTC to your Arduino and breadboard, then follow these steps to add your new DS3231 library to the Arduino IDE:
* Open the Arduino IDE
* In the toolbar at the top, navigate to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library"
* Find the DS3231.zip library you downloaded above, and click Open
* Your new library should now be imported into Arduino IDE

**Step 3:** Copy and paste the following code into a new Arduino file:
```c++
#include <DS3231.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal.h> // includes the LiquidCrystal Library

const int rs = 13;    // Set up pins for LCD screen
const int enable = 12;
const int d4 = 11;
const int d5 = 10;
const int d6 = 9;
const int d7 = 8;
const int button = 7; // Set pin for button
byte buttonState = 0;

DS3231 rtc(SDA, SCL);
LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, enable, d4, d5, d6, d7);

void setup()
{
  lcd.clear();      // Clear the LCD screen
  rtc.begin();      // Initialize the DS3231 RTC
  lcd.begin(16,2);  // Initialize the LCD screen and set the columns and rows

  pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP); // Initialize button as INPUT

//  rtc.setTime(22,53,30);  // Uncomment this line to reset the time
//  rtc.setDate(3,10,2019);  // Uncomment this line to reset the date
}

void loop()
{
  buttonState = digitalRead(button);
  if(buttonState == LOW){
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.setCursor(0,0);   // Set the cursor at column 0, row 0
    lcd.print("Time:  ");
    lcd.print(rtc.getTimeStr());  // Print the time
  } else {
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.setCursor(0,0);   // Set the cursor at column 0, row 1
    lcd.print("Date: ");
    lcd.print(rtc.getDateStr());  // Prints the date
  }

  delay(1000);  // Delay for one second
}
```

**Step 4:** Read the comments in the Arduino file BEFORE uploading to set the time and date on your DS3231 Real-Time Clock.

**Step 5:** Begin laying out your box idea - sketch your proposed design for either the laser cutter or 3D printer. **This prototype phase is important** - there are a number of variables that can be hard to account for without prior experience, such as what components will be difficult to mount properly, which components should be accessible from outside the enclosure, and what your ideal material for the enclosure should be based on your environment.
