# Week 2: January 14-18, 2019

**Coding** is the topic of the week. We'll be programming multiple LEDs to be controlled by potentiometers, photocells, and pushbuttons, as well as discovering the simple and complex logic of computer systems through the Arduino microcontroller.

## [Analog vs. Digital](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/all)

In today's world, perceiving the difference between a natural analog signal and the computer-driven digital signal might seem nearly impossible - and that's generally a good thing. If you've ever wondered why [recorded music got worse before it got better](https://www.quora.com/Are-CDs-better-audio-quality-than-an-MP3), or why even modern video games still can't perfectly trick our eyes ([but they're close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2BTDCTY8yw)), this short read might guide your understanding.

## Understanding Why We Code

Our at-work conversation will focus on coding and computer logic. Check here later for a review of that content.
