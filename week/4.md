# Week 4: January 28 - February 1

This week, we will talk briefly about analog inputs, open our new sensor kits, and begin assembling a simple robot.

## Analog World

Our in-class discussion will focus on what makes an analog signal. Check back here later for a review of that material.

## Sensor Kit Parts

For the writing exercise, use [this website image](https://www.elegoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1-37%E5%A5%97%E4%BB%B62.0%E6%8B%BC%E5%9B%BE20161129.jpg). Feel free to use the [template](http://jlaurentpdx.github.io/beginning-maker-tech/docs/Week4_SensorIdentification.docx) provided or start a new document, answering the following questions:

  * What is the name of the sensor youâ€™ve picked?

  * How does it work?

  * What is an example application of this sensor?

  * Can you find a project that someone else has completed using this sensor? Please provide a link to where you found the project - include a picture on this document if possible.

## Project Potential

The world of electronics opens up fully when you start considering projects of your own. We will spend some time in class researching and exploring projects that others have completed, documented, and shared so that we can further explore the "Internet of Things." Take a look at some of the following websites to get yourself started, or consider searching the web for "Arduino _____" - you'll usually find something that can pique your interest.
