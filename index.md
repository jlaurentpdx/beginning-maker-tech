## Week 1: January 7-11, 2019

This week, we will begin with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - the open-source microcontroller that will be powering our projects through this course. Each student will receive a starter kit that includes an Elegoo UNO board (based on the [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno)), breadboard, and various sensors, components, and motors.
